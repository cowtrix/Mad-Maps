Current Version:

v 0.1.3

- Road nodes will now update their snapping before rebaking
- Added icons for Splat and Detail wrappers
- Fixed replacing World Stamps from the World Stamp Creator when also capturing a road network
- Fixed "splat missing texture" error when assigning a Splat Wrapper with no texture
- Fixed the heightmap, splat maps and detail maps being erased when they weren't being written to by the Terrain Wrapper
- Fixed slight assymetry on Set Detail Splats road component
- Drastically improved core architecture to allow for easier development of further extensions and widgets
- Fixed incorrect handling of terrain layer objects, where occassionally their instances would not be pooled properly
- Added the ability to lock both Terrain Wrappers and Layers, which will mean they will not alter their data
- Added 'dirtiness' indicator for layers, indicating that they may need to be rebaked. A layer may become dirty when underlying data changes, or when certain events happen like a stamp is moved.


== History ==

v 0.1.2d

- Fixed an exception if you tried to capture from a Terrain with a detail prototype, where neither the Prototype Texture or Prototype Model were defined (thanks DocSavage!)
- Fixed errors when popping out the Terrain Wrapper inspector into its own window
- Fixed innacurate splat renormalisation with the Set Terrain Splat road component
- Added a clickable gizmo cube to all stamps to make them easier to select
- Improved behaviour and errors when attempting to use multiple layers with different resolutions
- Fixed relative-to-stamp object placement when scaling world stamps on the Y axis
- Added ability to disable stencil writing on world stamps - this allows you to create stamps that do things like only add trees on the same layer as existing stamps.
- Objects will now be organised according to their source under the ObjectContainer (thanks Jerome!)
- Improved Splat/Detail management. You can now resolve and create new splat/detail wrappers from their respective tabs on the Terrain Wrapper

v 0.1.2c

- Fixed Set Terrain Splat road connection component
- Fixed more GUI harmless exception spam
- Improved some issues when capturing only certain layers for a stamp
- World Stamps will now update their snapping just before they are applied
- Fixed some errors with painting large masks with the fallback OpenGL mode
- Fixed blur brush for painter
- Fixed specifying a manual zero level on stamp capturing
- Removed debug code from WorldStamp object removal
- Added "Normalize Preview" button in Data Inspector

v 0.1.2b

- Fixed GUI error spam when selecting the Terrain Wrapper for the first time and rebaking World Stamps.
- Fixed a problem where MapMagic outputs could nullify some wrappers
- Fixed some exceptions when rebaking Road components outside of a Road Network

v 0.1.2a

- Fixed compute shaders in 2018 and above

v 0.1.2

- Fixed painter on OpenGL platforms. If painting masks doesn't work for you, try enabling the fallback override with Tools/Mad Maps/Utilities/Force Fallback Painter
- Improved painter tearing down, could sometimes leave an orphaned painter floating in the scene until recompile
- Added VegetationStudio x MapMagic integrated generator
- Fixed WorldStamps properly removing existing Vegetation Studio data
- World Stamps will now properly configure themselves to remove existing data based on their own information, when created with the World Stamp Creator tool.
- Improved the World Stamp priority explorer

v 0.1.1

- Map Magic Integration: Fixed terrain heightmap welding.
- Vegetation Studio Integration: Added VegetationStudio data layers to the TerrainWrapper and World Stamps. 
- Vegetation Studio Integration: Added VegetationStudio modifiers to the road tool.
- Data Inspector: Added the ability to preview object/position data such as trees, objects and more.
- TerrainWrapper: Fixed making an object container when it doesn't need to.
- Road Network: Fixed bug where nodes could share their configuration, causing unexpected behaviour.
- Generic Editor: Fixes for drawing some null objects. Added more basic drawers.
